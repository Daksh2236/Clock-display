21.  It starts off at 00:00 because in the constructor it does not have value to be set in the parameters

23.  You would need to call the timeTick method 60 time for it to rollback and make it 01:00
     We can also display that time by using the setTime method
     
24. NumberDisplay digit = new NumberDisplay(10);

25. Rectangle window = new rectangle(int lenght, int sides);

26. The second constructor is able to set the time at a specific time
    It does it by creating 2 NumberDisplay then you are able to set the value of them (hours and minutes)
    
27. Most of the code is the same for both constuctors except the last line
    There isn't updateDisplay in the second one because it doesn't need to be updated since we are setting its time, the updateDisplay will run when the timeTick gets called

28. System.out.println("+ filename");
    
    return status;  

29. Square
    Triangle
    Circle 
    
30. moveHorizontal(int distance)
    moveVertical(int Distance)
    makeVisible()
    changeSize(int newHeight, int newWidth) 
    
31. Yes the picture class does have internal methods

32. The result of (8 % 3) is 2 (int)

33. When you use the modulo operator with negative numbers the result is a negative remainder

34. The possible results are any number between -4 & 4

35. The posible results are any integer number that is smaller than m but doesn't go past -m
